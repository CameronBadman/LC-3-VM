A implementation of the LC-3 virtual machine written in C. The LC-3 is a 16-bit educational computer architecture, and this project emulates its instruction set, memory, and registers.

## Features

- Full emulation of the LC-3 instruction set.
- Supports loading and executing LC-3 object files (`.obj`).
- Basic terminal-based I/O for interaction.

it is based in the vm in https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/ but is heavily modified to make it more robust
